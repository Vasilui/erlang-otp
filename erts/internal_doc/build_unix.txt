Building OTP in clearcase
-------------------------

(For building from sources see the file ../../README)

1. setenv CLEARCASE_MAKE_COMPAT gnu
   setenv ERL_TOP /clearcase/otp/erts

2. Go to the directory $ERL_TOP

3. Type 'clearmake -V do_configure'. The configuration is determined
   and then some Makefiles are created.

4. Go to /clearcase/otp/erts. Type

	clearmake

   This will first build a new emulator then the applications.

To run what you have just built, type

	/clearcase/otp/erts/bin/erl


Building test suites
--------------------

Go to /clearcase/otp/erts.

Run
	clearmake release_tests TESTROOT=<path>


Running test suites
-------------------

Go to the `test_server' directory of the installed test suite.

Start the Erlang system you want to test.

The first time, run ts:install().

To run a single test suite, ts:run(Name).
