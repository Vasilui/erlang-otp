Tools and stuff needed to build OTP for Win32.
----------------------------------------------

Theese are the tools necessary to build and install Erlang/OTP for Win32 using the
current build/install/test environment.

Note 1: I might have missed something here, just blame me for it and I'll fix it ASAP
Note 2: '\\' prefixed paths are Windows shared paths

ClearCase for Windows NT
------------------------
Internal Location:  Patrik Nyblom
Version:            3.2
Things to consider: Not absolutely necessary, you can build using a plain 
		    NFS mounted drive, but that is not recommended.
		    Use 'omake', not nmake or clearmake.

NFS client for Windows NT (Intergraph Diskaccess 03.02.00.11)
-------------------------
Internal Location: Patrik Nyblom
Things to consider: Configure Group access RWX, and filenames matching to 
"Preserve case [no conversion]" as well as  both "Match filenames exactly" and 
"Match filenames ignoring case"

Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
------------------------
Internal Location:  Kenneth Lundin
Things to consider: Make sure you have all the VC environment variables set
		    (VCVARS32.BAT)


GCC 2.8.1 for Win32 (Mingw32, NOT CygWin32)
-------------------------------------------
Available at:       http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~janjaap/mingw32/
Internal location:  \\Vilya\Public\ftproot\pub\Windows\Win32\mingw32\
Things to consider: Read the installation page at the above URL.
		    Make sure you have the environment set.


GNU SED for Win32
-----------------
Available at:       http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/contributors.html
Internal location:  \\Vilya\Public\ftproot\pub\Windows\Win32\gnused.zip
Things to consider: Just have 'sed.exe' in your path.


Perl 5 for Win32
----------------
Available at:       http://www.ActiveState.com/
Internal location:  \\Vilya\Public\ftproot\pub\Windows\Win32\Perl_w32i316.exe
Things to consider: This is the only version of Perl for Win32 that has been
		    tested. The installation procedure is depending on the 
		    Win32 module for registry lookups and will fail if it cannot
		    find it.
	            Associate .pl files with Perl to make the scripts work properly.




A brief description of what the files in the install_nt/wise directory do
----------------------------------------------------------
Makefile  -  Pretty obvious.
             Two main targets defined: 'default' and 'install'
             'default' will build the OTP installation executable into the current
	               directory. TESTROOT must be set on the make command line.
                       
             'install' will ensure that 'default' is up to date and then uninstalls
	               any version of Erlang conflicting with the version it wants to
		       install (the one built with 'default'), and then installs the
		       new Erlang version. All this is handled by the Perl script
		       'autorun.pl'. TESTROOT must be set on the make command line.

erlang.wse - This is the main WISE script used to create the installation. Sed
	     transforms this file into erlang-main.wse substituting some variables.

data-files.wse - This file is generated with the genwse.pl Perl script. It has all the
                 main data files needed by the installation (eg. jam|erl|hrl|etc..)

[ps]doc-files.wse -  Theese files are also generated by the genwse.pl script and holds
                     Postscript/HTML documentation. When building progress builds,
		     theese files will normally be (almost) empty.
		     (Don't be alarmed by warning/error messages during creation of
		      theese files if you don't have any documentation built)

autorun.pl.in - This is the source for autorun.pl run through sed during 'install'
		build. It manages removal and installation of the Erlang installation.
