Tools and stuff needed to build OTP for Win32.
----------------------------------------------

Theese are the tools necessary to build and install Erlang/OTP for
Win32 using the current build/install/test environment.

Note 1: I might have missed something here, just blame me for it and
	I'll fix it ASAP 
Note 2: '\\' prefixed paths are Windows shared paths

Note 3: Clearcase and NFS are only needed to do serious development in
	our environment, a tar file created with $ERLTOP/otp_pack can
	replace them...

ClearCase for Windows NT
------------------------
Internal Location:  \\eomer\D_DISK\Clearcase4\setup.exe
Version:            4
Things to consider: Not absolutely necessary, see note above.  Run the
	  setup.exe and when asked, accept the site prepased defaults.
	  Change the settings of clearcase to "case insensitive MVFS"
	  in "Clearcase Home Base"->Administration->"Control
	  panel"->MVFS, you might also want to up the scaling factor
	  in the tab "MVFS Performace" (also in the Clearcase control
	  panel).


NFS client for Windows NT (DiskAccess)
--------------------------------------
Internal Location:  \\Eomer\D_DISK\OTP-program\DiskAccess5u\dan5intel.exe
Things to consider: read in README, you need original CD and keys

Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
------------------------
Internal Location:  Kenneth Lundin
Things to consider: Make sure you have all the VC environment variables set
		    (VCVARS32.BAT)

Cygwin:
--------------------------------------
Internal Location:  \\Eomer\D_DISK\OTP-program\cygwin_install
Things to consider: Copy the whole directory to your local disk and
       then install from there selecting the option "install from
       local directory".  DO NOT INSTALL DIRECTLY FROM EOMER, HEAR ME?
       Select everything available when installing. The best method of
       installing is to login as a *local* user with the same name as
       your network user and then install. If you install as a OTP_NT
       domain user, you might need to hack a little in /etc/passwd and
       /etc/group o get things to work properly. If you don't have a
       home directory in the windows environment, you will get one
       under <cygwin root>/home/<username>, which will work fair
       enough.

NSIS:
--------------------------------------
Internal Location:  \\Eomer\D_DISK\OTP-program\NSIS
Things to consider: Install the lot.

Erlang:
--------------------------------------
Internal Location: /usr/local/otp/distributions
Things to consider: Used for primary bootstrap *only*, not needed if building 
       from an open source tar file.

Java
--------------------------------------
Internal Location:  \\Eomer\D_DISK\OTP-program\JDK
