Original authors:

The original JAM emulator was first implemented by Mike Williams (the
instruction set was argued out with Joe Armstrong).

The original BEAM emulator and loader were first implemented by Bogumil Hausman.
They were completely rewritten by Björn Gustavsson.

Over the years the emulator has been basically completely rewritten by
a large number of individuals. Most(?) notably Claes Wikström, Tony
Rogvall, Björn Gustavsson, Patrik Nyblom and Arndt Jonasson.

Marcus Arendt did the original port for Windows NT. Most of this code
was rewritten by Björn Gustavsson, Patrik Nyblom, Kenneth Lundin,
Fredrik Tillman and  Mattias Nilsson.

Per Hedeland did the original port for VxWorks. This port was
improved by Peter Högfeldt, Patrik Nyblom and Patrik Winroth.

There are also a lot of people who have contributed smaller (and
bigger) things to the emulator and runtime system: Per Hedeland,
Peter Högfeldt, Kenneth Lundin, Fredrik Tillman, Mattias Nilsson,
Kent Boortz, Markus Torpvret, Jan-Erik Dahlin, Sebastian Strollo
and perhaps more...
