        <item>
	    <p>HiPE runtime system:</p>
	    <p>* added notes about supported systems to README</p>
	    <p>* support 32-bit x86 on FreeBSD</p>
	    <p>* autoenable HiPE on FreeBSD (32-bit x86) and Solaris
	    (64-bit x86)</p>
	    <p>* updated x86 runtime system to support glibc-2.5</p>
	    <p>* work around probable gcc-4.1.1 bug affecting the x86
	    runtime system</p>
	    <p>HiPE compiler:
	    <p>* improved performance of integer multiplications on
	    all platforms</p>
	    <p>* corrected a code optimisation error in R11B-2 that
	    broke some bsl/bsr operations on all platforms</p>
	    <p>* corrected a type error in the ARM backend which
	    could cause the compiler to crash</p>
	    <p>* corrected an error in the SPARC backend's naive
	    register allocator which could throw the compiler into an
	    infinite loop</p>

<section><title>Hipe 3.6.0</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>Support for native code on Solaris 10/AMD64.</p>
	    <p>Support for native code on FreeBSD/AMD64.</p>
	    <p>Native code now handles external funs (<c>fun
	    M:F/A</c>). Native code can now also apply so-called
	    tuple-funs (<c>{M,F}</c>). (Tuple funs are NOT
	    recommended for new code; they are deprecated and will be
	    removed in some future release.)</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>Improved compilation of receives for the SMP runtime
	    system.</p>
	    <p>Improved code quality in HiPE compiler on ARM.</p>
	    <p>Fix bug in handling of re-raised exceptions in
	    try-catch.</p>
	    <p>(HiPE loader) When native code is incompatible with
	    the current runtime system, fall back to loading the BEAM
	    code.</p>
