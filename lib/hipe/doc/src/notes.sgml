	    <p>Support for native code on Solaris 10/AMD64.</p>
	    <p>Support for native code on FreeBSD/AMD64.</p>
	    <p>Native code now handles external funs (<c>fun
	    M:F/A</c>). Native code can now also apply so-called
	    tuple-funs (<c>{M,F}</c>). (Tuple funs are NOT
	    recommended for new code; they are deprecated and will be
	    removed in some future release.)</p>
