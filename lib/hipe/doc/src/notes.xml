        <item>
          <p>HiPE runtime system:</p>
          <p>* added notes about supported systems to README</p>
          <p>* support 32-bit x86 on FreeBSD</p>
          <p>* autoenable HiPE on FreeBSD (32-bit x86) and Solaris
            (64-bit x86)</p>
          <p>* updated x86 runtime system to support glibc-2.5</p>
          <p>* work around probable gcc-4.1.1 bug affecting the x86
            runtime system</p>
          <p>HiPE compiler:</p>
          <p>* improved performance of integer multiplications on
            all platforms</p>
          <p>* corrected a code optimisation error in R11B-2 that
            broke some bsl/bsr operations on all platforms</p>
          <p>* corrected a type error in the ARM backend which
            could cause the compiler to crash</p>
          <p>* corrected an error in the SPARC backend's naive
            register allocator which could throw the compiler into an
            infinite loop</p>

      <title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>Support for native code on Solaris 10/AMD64.</p>
          <p>Support for native code on FreeBSD/AMD64.</p>
          <p>Native code now handles external funs (<c><![CDATA[fun M:F/A]]></c>). Native code can now also apply so-called
            tuple-funs (<c><![CDATA[{M,F}]]></c>). (Tuple funs are NOT
            recommended for new code; they are deprecated and will be
            removed in some future release.)</p>

          <p>Fix bug in handling of re-raised exceptions in
            try-catch.</p>
          <p>(HiPE loader) When native code is incompatible with
            the current runtime system, fall back to loading the BEAM
            code.</p>
