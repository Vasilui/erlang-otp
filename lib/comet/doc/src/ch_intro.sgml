  <section><title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In Windows, many applications and libraries call each
      other using COM. COM, short for Component Object Model,
      is Microsoft's technique for component software and
      distributed computing. COM enables code to be called
      across language boundaries. For instance, a Visual Basic
      program can call modules and classes written in C++, and
      vice versa.
    <p>Comet is a module for Erlang, that enables Erlang programs
      to call COM objects.
    <p>This document describes Comet and its possible applications.
      However, some knowledge of COM is assumed. Please check the list
      of recommended reading below for tips on books on COM.

  <section><title>Architecture</title>

    <p>Comet is a module that consists of two parts: a genserver,
      called erl_com, that implements the Erlang part of Comet, and
      a port driver erl_com_drv, that implements the C glue. The port
      driver is also available as a port program with the same API from
      Erlang.
   
    <p>Since COM is a Windows-specific technology, Comet is only
      available on Windows.
    <p>Erlang can only call other COM-servers, Comet does not currently
      provide for creating COM-objects written in Erlang. This might be
      included in later versions. Thus Comet is a COM-client only.
