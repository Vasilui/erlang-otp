    <p>
      New release.
    <p>
      Greatly improved everything.
    <p>
      Comet can now be run as a port program and/or a port driver. The
      same API works in both.
    <p>
      Now generates Erlang wrapper modules around COM objects and
      interfaces, using information in COM TypeLibs.
    <p>
      Examples include controlling Internet Explorer, using Excel and
      accessing data through ADO.
