  <appsummary>The COM client for Erlang
  <description>
    <p>
    Comet, the COM client for Erlang, is a way to call any COM-service
    in Windows from an Erlang program. It is a combination of a gen_server
    and a port program (or port driver) that enables Erlang programs to call
    almost any COM-server.
    <p>
    Comet uses a gen_server in the module erl_com, together with a port program
    (or port driver), to call COM-servers. Both the late-binding interface
    IDispatch and early-binding virtual interfaces can be used. Erlang types
    are converted to COM types and parameters are returned.
    <p>
    COM stands for Component Object Model, (or sometimes Common Object Model),
    and is MicroSoft's technique for component-based programming. It allows
    programs on Windows systems, to call other programs and libraries across
    language boundaries. It is a competitor to Corba, but has other functionality
    too.
    <p>
    COM is available on all 32-bit Windows systems, such as NT 4, Windows 95,
    Windows 98 and Windows 2000. Comet can be used on any of these.
    <p>
    With Comet, an Erlang application can use (almost) any COM-service on
    Windows from Erlang. Examples of what can be done include:
    <list>
      <item><p>Opening webpages with Internet Exporer (or Netscape)</item>
      <item><p>Reading and writing data from Excel Worksheet</item>
      <item><p>Reading and writing from Word</item>
      <item><p>Call C-code-libraries an efficient way, without the hassle
	  of creating a port-driver</item>
      <item><p>Execute scripts in VBScript or JavaScript</item>
    </list>
    <p>
    Each of these examples are described in <c>comet_examples</c>.
    <p>
    Using Comet for other purposes than those described in the examples,
    requires knowledge of COM. COM is a complex topic, and there are a lot of
    books written about it. Three decent references are given below. Some
    sections of the Comet documentation assumes basic knowledge of COM.
