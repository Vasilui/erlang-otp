This directory contains a Java Applet which uses the Jive interface 
to communicate with an Erlang server.

Start the Erlang server, in the server directory, on a host of your
choice:

Start the Java Applet e.g.

appletviewer timer.html

A ticking clock will appear in the Applet window.

Note! If you put the Applet in a Web-server; The Erlang server need to
be started on the same host. This is true if the WWW browser you
intend to use only supports "Applet Host" security mode, e.g. Netscape
Navigator etc.
