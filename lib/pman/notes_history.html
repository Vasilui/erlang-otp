PMAN now handles when a node becomes distributed/undistributed using
the functions net_kernel:start/1 and net_kernel:stop/0.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2002


<LI>
Sometimes an attempt to kill a process would kill an
important system process and cause the entire system 
to crash. This has been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2342


<LI>
Sometimes PMAN would crash during refresh when the code for one 
of the supervised processes was recompiled. This has been fixed.

<A NAME="18.1.3"><!-- Empty --></A><H4>18.1.3 Incompatibilities with PMAN 2.1.0</H4><P> There are no known incompatibilities with PMAN 2.1.0.

<P> There was a change to the module interface between PMAN
2.0.3 and PMAN 2.1.0, however this was not well described in the
previous release notes. The changes are described in more
detail below.


<P><UL>
<LI> The module interface to <CODE>pman</CODE> has
         changed. <BR>


         <CODE>pman:start/0</CODE> and <CODE>pman:start/1</CODE> now return
         the Pid of PMANs main window process if the start-up
         succeeds within 20 seconds, otherwise it will fail with
         the EXIT reason <CODE>{startup_timeout, pman}</CODE>. The
         returned Pid is the Pid of the PMAN that was
         started. Previously <CODE>pman:start/0</CODE> and
         <CODE>pman:start/1</CODE> returned a tuple, <CODE>{ok, Pid}</CODE>
         immediately, even if PMAN didn't start properly.<BR>


         There are two new functions, <CODE>pman:start_notimeout/0</CODE>, and
         pman:start_notimeout/1, that starts PMAN and returns the Pid
         of a successfully started PMAN. These functions will not
         fail with an EXIT reason after a specified time, but will
         wait indefinitely until PMAN has started successfully.<BR>

         
         (*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)<BR>

         Own Id:OTP-1858, OTP-1859. <BR>

         <LI> PMAN does not handle when the node it is running on
        becomes distributed.<BR>

          Own Id: OTP-2003<BR>

         <LI> PMAN allows several trace windows to be opened for
        the same PID when all trace options are set to false.<BR>
