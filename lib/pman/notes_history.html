  <H3>Incompatibilities with Pman 2.1.0</H3>
  <P>There are no known incompatibilities with PMAN 2.1.0.</P>

  <P>There was a change to the module interface between PMAN 2.0.3 and PMAN 2.1.0, however this was not well described in the previous release notes. The changes are described in more detail below.</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>The module interface to <CODE>pman</CODE> has changed.<BR>

      <CODE>pman:start/0</CODE> and <CODE>pman:start/1</CODE> now return the Pid of PMANs main window process if the start-up succeeds within 20 seconds, otherwise it will fail with the EXIT reason <CODE>{startup_timeout, pman}</CODE>. The returned Pid is the Pid of the PMAN that was started. Previously <CODE>pman:start/0</CODE> and <CODE>pman:start/1</CODE> returned a tuple, <CODE>{ok, Pid}</CODE> immediately, even if PMAN didn't start properly.<BR>


      There are two new functions, <CODE>pman:start_notimeout/0</CODE>, and pman:start_notimeout/1, that starts PMAN and returns the Pid of a successfully started PMAN. These functions will not fail with an EXIT reason after a specified time, but will wait indefinitely until PMAN has started successfully.<BR>
