<H2>Jinterface Release Notes</H2>

<P>This document describes the changes made to Jinterface.

<H3>Jinterface 1.2.1</H3>
<H4>Fixed bugs</H4>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
 
         a bug on the constructor for OtpNode which caused 
         NullPointerException, is fixed. <BR>

</LI>


</UL>
<H3>Jinterface 1.2</H3>
<H4>New features</H4>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
  a new class, AbstractConnection, has been added to deal
with most of the aspects of the Erlang communication protocol,
and which can be subclassed in order to provide different
levels of support to the application as necessary.
OtpConnection is now a subclass to AbstractConnection. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  OtpCookedConnection is a new subclass to
AbstractConnection, which together with OtpNode provides an
intuitive mailbox-based communication mechanism. By using this
interface, applications are no longer required to manage
connections explicitly, since the OtpNode now opens and manages
connections to remote nodes as needed. Outgoing messages are
sent through mailboxes and automatically dispatched through the
correct connections to the destination node, while incoming
messages are queued in the destination mailbox. This allows
parts of an application to communicate with several peers
simultaneously without the need to sort and dispatch incoming
messages. Additionally, mailboxes can be linked with Erlang
processes or with each other, in much the same manner that
Erlang processes can be linked together. <BR>


</LI>


</UL>

<H4>Changes and additions</H4>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
  The node class hierarchy has changed. The top class
is now AbstractNode, and direct subclasses are OtpPeer and
OtpLocalNode, of which the latter is extended by OtpNode and
OtpSelf. This does not change the functionality of any of the
existing classes or methods that take node arguments, however
it was necessary in order to group OtpNode and OtpSelf and to
provide some common methods for them. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  OtpServer is now deprecated. Its functionality has
been added to OtpSelf. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  an open OtpConnection no longer requires service on
a regular basis in order to keep the remote Erlang node from
disconnecting. OtpConnection now extends java.lang.Thread so it
can keep the connection open and respond to ticks when needed,
without intervention from the application. Incoming messages
are automatically received and queued for subsequent retrieval
through one of the receive methods. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  tracing of inter-node communication can now be set
on a per-connection basis. The system property
OtpConnection.trace is still used as before, but now sets only
the initial trace level for new connections. Once a connection
has been created, its current trace level can be set or
retrieved through new methods setTraceLevel and getTraceLevel. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  constructors for OtpErlangAtom and OtpErlangTuple
previously declared that OtpErlangDataException would be thrown
for certain types of input. These constructors now throw
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException instead, which is a runtime
exception and is therefore not declared explicitly, nor is it
necessary for the caller to explicitly catch it. The rules for
creating atoms and tuples have not changed however. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  some of the constructors for OtpErlangPid,
OtpErlangPort and OtpErlangRef are now deprecated. The various
OtpNode classes provide factory methods instead. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
  OtpErlangObject and all subclasses representing
Erlang data types now implement java.io.Serializable and
java.lang.Cloneable. <BR>


</LI>


<LI>
 
          a user's guide is now available. <BR>

         Own Id: OTP-3424<BR>


</LI>


</UL>
<H4>Fixed bugs</H4>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
  a bug in the MD5 handshaking code, that could cause the
         connection to fail when the Java node was run in a 7-bit
         character encoding environment, has now been fixed. <BR>

          Own Id: OTP-3512 <BR>

        
</LI>


<LI>
  a bug in OtpErlangList, which caused message corruption 
when empty list where encoded, is fixed. <BR>

          Own Id: OTP-3564 <BR>

        
</LI>


</UL>
<H3>Jinterface 1.1</H3>
<H4>Improvements and new features</H4>

<P>
<UL>

<LI>
                 Modifications for using along with new IC types.
         <BR>

                 Some modifications were done on classes OtpInputStream amd OtpOutputStream 
         in order to work with the new types added on IC.
         <BR>

         Own Id: OTP-3331<BR>

         <BR>

        
</LI>


<LI>
                 Machine-depended character encoding problems fixed.
         <BR>

                 The character encoding (LC_CTYPE) need no longer be 
         defined to an eight bit character set for 
         jinterface connections to work.
         <BR>

         Own Id: OTP-3512<BR>
