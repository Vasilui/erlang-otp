<H2>Erl_interface 3.2</H2>
<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
The reference type has been extended from 18 bits to
82 bits. For compatibility with older nodes, an R6 node
can send a ref to an older node; if the older node sends
it back, it has lost all but its 18 least significant
bits, but still compares equal to the original ref.
The external format has been extended to represent the new
longer refs; that means for example that binaries with
refs, produced on an R6 node, cannot be converted to a term
on an older node.
In <CODE>erl_interface</CODE>, a function <CODE>erl_mk_long_ref</CODE>
has been added, and macros <CODE>ERL_REF_NUMBERS</CODE> and
<CODE>ERL_REF_LEN</CODE>.

Aux Id: OTP-3139


<LI>
The function <CODE>erl_receive_msg</CODE> has the problem that
a fixed buffer must be given - a larger message than
expected is simply discarded. A function
<CODE>erl_xreceive_msg</CODE> has been introduced, which
dynamically resizes the buffer given to it, if needed.
