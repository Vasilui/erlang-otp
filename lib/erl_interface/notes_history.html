<H2>Erl_interface 3.1.1</H2>
<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>#ifdef __cplusplus extern C {</CODE> is added to all the 
<CODE>erl*.h</CODE> and <CODE>ei*.h</CODE> files in order to support 
use from C++.<br>
On Unix the object files are now produced with the <CODE>-fPIC</CODE>
option to make it possible to include them in a shared library.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3138<br>
Aux Id: Seq 1722


</UL>
<H2>Erl_interface 3.1</H2>
<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
A buffer overflow in erl_connect() was causing C-node crashes on Linux.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2743


<LI>
When decoding very long strings (more than 65535 characters) the terminating 0 was left out.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2744


<LI>
erl_accept() was not handshaking properly with Erlang, causing incoming connection attempts to fail.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2862


<LI>
Very large negative numbers are no longer encoded incorrectly.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2897


<LI>
Atoms could sometimes contain an unterminated string. This is fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2956


<LI>
Erl_interface now uses the SENS resolver functions if they are available at runtime. 
This primarily concerns use on the VxWorks platform.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3034<br>
Aux Id: Seq 1559


<LI>
The documentation for erl_connect_init() no longer makes erroneous reference to the remote node.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3102<br>
Aux Id: Seq 1671


</UL>
<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Erl_interface has been moved out of the Erlang runtime
system (Erts) and is now a separate application. This has
implications for all users of Erl_interface, who will need to
make changes to the Makefiles used to build applications based
on Erl_interface. In particular, header and library files are
no longer in $(OTPROOT)/usr/. The include and lib directories
are now located in the directory $(OTPROOT)/lib/erl_interface-3.1 (i.e.
the directory name is now version specific).
