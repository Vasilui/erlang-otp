    <p><em>Syntax_Tools</em> contains modules for handling abstract
      Erlang syntax trees, in a way that is compatible with the "parse
      trees" of the STDLIB module <c>erl_parse</c>, together with
      utilities for reading source files in unusual ways and
      pretty-printing syntax trees. Also included is an amazing module
      merger and renamer called Igor, as well as an automatic
      code-cleaner.</p>
