This is the etk package, a tight binding between Erlang and
tk4.2 which makes it possible to write GUI programs in
erlang which directly manipulate all the widgets found in tk4.2
in a manner similar to tcl. Hence in a way this library 
replaces tcl with erlang.

To build this packege the Makefiles need to have a pointer
to the source code of tk4.2 and tcl7.6, this can be given
to the configure script as

% ./configure --with-tcl <dir> --with-tk <dir>

as well as the source code of the erlang system itself
with

% ./configure --with-erl <dir>

In the distribution of Open Source Erlang these values
default to the following

with-erl: $ERL_TOP
with-tcl: $ERL_TOP/lib/gs/c_src/lib/tcl7.6
with-tk:  $ERL_TOP/lib/gs/c_src/lib/tk4.2

So if the "gs" library exists in the $ERL_TOP/lib/ directory
"etk" should build right inplace.


% setenv ERL_TOP <dir>
% gmake


"etk" is ditributed together with the "gs_apps.tar.gz" file
for convenience only.

The documentation of this library is almost non existant
since the API is almost one-to-one visavi the tk4.2 widgets.

Furthermore, in order to be able to effectively use this
library, understanding the GUI programming concepts of tcl/tk
is absoluteley essential. Therefore we recommend a good book
on tcl/tk such as "Effective Tcl/Tk Programming"
by "Mark Harrisson and Michael McLennan, Addison Wesley 1998" 
as an introductory text to the "etk" library.

The doc directory contains html files of all the supported
tk4.2 widgets.
