<H2>SASL 1.10 (R9C)</H2>
 <H3>Improvements and new features</H3>
 <UL>
  <LI>
   <P>Moved the OTP MIBs that were included in the application to the new
     application OTP_MIBs. The OTP MIBs had no real connection to SASL and
     it is desirable that the core of Erlang/OTP is not dependent on SNMP.
     <BR>
     Own Id: OTP-4686</P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
   <P>Renamed unused variables so that they begin with an underscore (_).
   </P>
  </LI>
 </UL>

<P>There are also release notes for <A HREF="notes_history.html">older
  versions</A>.</P>
