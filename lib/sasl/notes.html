 <H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>
 <UL>
  <LI>
   <P>OTP-3998: <CODE>systools:make_relup/3,4</CODE> now generates upgrade
    instructions for the applications in start order, instead of in reversed
    start order.</P>
   <P>OTP-4121: <CODE>systools:make_script/1,2</CODE> now keeps the order
    of the release resource file (<CODE>.rel</CODE>) also for included

      If a new application was added using <CODE>code:replace_path/2</CODE>,
      the <CODE>code:lib_dir/1</CODE> function would fail on the new
      application name. This has been corrected.<BR>

<H2>Sasl 1.9 (R7B)</H2>
  <H3>Fixed Errors and Malfunctions</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      In the release handler the upgrade instructions before
      the point_of_no_return instruction, were executed in reverse order.<BR>

    <LI>
      In the release handler, the tar file containing a release was not
      removed after the release had been successfully unpacked.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3605
    </LI>
    <LI>
      In the release handler, the relative matching of release versions
      (e.g. 3.1 matches 3.1.1) was wrong. Such matching has been removed
      altogether, and now only exact matches are allowed.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3606
    </LI>
    <LI>
      In systools, when reordering instructions with respect to dependency,
      the case of duplicate instructions for the same module was not
      properly checked.<BR>

<H2>Sasl 1.8.3</H2>
  <H3>Fixed Errors and Malfunctions</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>
      Release handler didn't find topmost supervisors.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3452
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Processes were suspended in the wrong order.<BR>
      Processes are now suspended and resumed in correct order: suspension
      is in the order of dependency, and resumption is in the reversed order
      of dependency (both for upgrade and downgrade). Furthermore, modules
      are loaded in the reversed order of dependency at upgrade, and in
      the order of dependency at downgrade.<BR>

    <LI>
      Empty suspend and remove instructions are now removed from boot
      scripts.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3469

      Modules added by the add_module instruction was not in the dependency
      chain.<BR>
