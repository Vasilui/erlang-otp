    <title>The fascicules DTD</title>

    <p>The <c>fascicules</c> DTD is a special kind of DTD which can be
      used to specify the different parts of the documentation, and
      which one of those should be shown as default. Example</p>

    <pre><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="latin1" ?>
<!DOCTYPE fascicules SYSTEM "fascicules.dtd">
<fascicules>
  <fascicule file="part" href="part_frame.html" entry="no">
    User's Guide
  </fascicule>
  <fascicule file="application" href="application_frame.html" entry="yes">
    Reference Manual
  </fascicule>
  <fascicule file="part_notes" href="part_notes_frame.html" entry="no">
    Release Notes
  </fascicule>
</fascicules>
    ]]></pre>

    <p>Specifies that the documentation for this application consists of
      three parts: User's Guide, where the "cover page" (with the two
      frames) is located in <c>part_frame.html</c>, Reference Manual
      with the cover page <c>application_frame.html</c> and Release
      Notes with the cover page <c>part_notes_frame.html</c>.</p>

    <p>As a result, at the top of the left frame in the generated HTML
      documentation, there will be corresponding links to User's Guide,
      Reference Manual and Release Notes.</p>

    <p>The <c>&lt;fascicules&gt;</c> attribute <c>entry</c> specifies
      that it is the Reference Manual which should be shown as default.
      This means that when generating the HTML files,
      <c>application_frame.html</c> will be copied to <c>index.html</c>.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>DocBuilder assumes that the XML file written according to
	the <c>fascicules</c> DTD is called <c>fascicules.xml</c>.</p>
    </note>

    <p>This file is optional. If it does not exist, there are no links
      to other parts of the documentation (as they are not known) in
      the left frame, and no <c>index.html</c> is created.</p>
