<H2>Asn1 1.2.9.6</H2>
<H3>Known problems</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
The compiler does not check that an exported name actually exists in the ASN.1 module.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3659


<LI>
The compiler does not check that a value referenced by name does exist.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3277



<LI>
BER: The compiler does not take the extensions into account when checking if
the tags are unique in a SEQUENCE or SET.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3304

</UL>

<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
PER: Trailing zeroes in a BIT STRING declared without named bits
 should not be removed in the encodings.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3830
</UL>

<H2>Asn1 1.2.9.5</H2>
<H3>Known problems</H3>
<P>Same as for 1.2.9.3.</P>

<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
PER: Constraints are not propagated when types are
referring to each other. Example:
<code> 
                TBCD-STRING ::= OCTET STRING
 
                LAI ::= TBCD-STRING (SIZE(3))
</code> 
                The size constraint is not passed on during encode,decode
                resulting in wrong encoding for PER , it is
                coded with a length determinant which should not be there
                when the length is fixed. For BER this does not matter because the constraints does
                not affect the encodings.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3713
                
<LI>
 The generated code gets wrong if there are several ENUMERATED fields in a SEQUENCE or SET, this is now corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3796

<LI>
BER:Decode of a type T ::= SEQUENCE OF C fails if C is encoded with indefinite length.
                This is know corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3811
</UL>

<H2>Asn1 1.2.9.3</H2>
<H3>Known problems</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
The compiler does not check that an exported name actually exists in the ASN.1 module.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3659


<LI>
The compiler does not check that a value referenced by name does exist.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3277



<LI>
BER: The compiler does not take the extensions into account when checking if
the tags are unique in a SEQUENCE or SET.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3304

</UL>

<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
This version supports soft upgrade from versions 1.2.6 1.2.7.

<LI>
In an ENUMERATED type like this:<br>
		T ::= ENUMERATED { blue, green}<br>
		The symbols was encoded/decoded with the wrong values, i.e in
		reverse order. This is now corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3700

<LI>
PER: OCTET STRING with Size constrained to a single value i.e fixed size
		was treated wrong during encode and decode. This is now corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3701
</UL>

<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
There is now a new compiler option <code>ber_bin</code> available that can be used to 
generate encode/decode functions for BER that uses the new "bit-syntax" to
make the functions more efficient. The <code>ber_bin</code> option is used
as an alternative to the <code>ber</code> and <code>per</code> options.
<p>
The encode function then produces a
possibly nested list of binaries and integer lists. The decode function does 
in this case require a single binary as input instead of a list.
The modules generated with this option require that you have an R7A  or later
system, otherwise they will not compile and the runtime module asn1rt_ber_bin
can not be executed.
<p>
The ber_bin option is not officially supported in this version (will be
in a later version) but is provided for those who want to try it. 
It should be significantly faster at decode and is slightly faster at encode.
Exactly how performance differs between this binary approach and the
list approach depends highly on the type of input.
Another thing worth noting is that both approaches still have a lot of
solutions in common which can be improved a lot to gain even better 
performance. 
</UL>

<H2>Asn1 1.2.9.2</H2>

<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>


<LI>
BER: Encode/decode of extension components did not work properly. This is now corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3395
<br>Aux Id: 

PER:The encode/decode of NULL as an open type has been corrected. An open type must always have a length of at least 1 byte even if the contained 
value (e.g NULL) encodes to nothing.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3496
<br>Aux Id: 

<LI>
BER:In the current implementation extension components of a SEQUENCE are required
to be present when they are specified as mandatory. This is an error, all extension
components are "optional" even if they are not specified to have the OPTIONAL or
DEFAULT property. This is now corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3278


</UL>

<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The ASN.1 language feature <CODE>COMPONENTS OF</CODE> is now implemented.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2515

<LI>
The encoding and decoding of ENUMERATED and
INTEGER with NamedNumbers is made more efficient and thus
faster in runtime.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3464
<br>Aux Id:

<LI>
Added support for encode/decode of open type which is
constrained to a specific type. Previously the value of
an open type had to be a list of  octets, but now the Erlang
representation of the specific type used in the constraint
is used both as input to encode and as output from decode.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3569
<br>Aux Id: 

<LI>
PER: GeneralString, GraphicalString etc. i.e all strings
that are not so called "known-multiplier character
string types" are now supported by the runtime 
encode/decode functions.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3573
<br>Aux Id:

</UL>
