      <UL>
        <LI><CODE>xref:m/1</CODE> has been changed to accept a filename.</LI>
        <LI>bug fix: the predefined analysis <CODE>locals_not_called</CODE>
          and <CODE>xref:m/1</CODE> could sometimes miss unused local
          functions.</LI>
        <LI>bug fix: the bit syntax is now recognized...</LI>
        <LI>bug fix: setting the library path to <CODE>code_path</CODE> did
          not force the setting up of data.</LI>
        <LI># has lower precedence now.</LI>
        <LI>only atoms are allowed as release and application names.</LI>
        <LI>invalid symbolic links are ignored unless the extension is
          recognized (<CODE>.beam</CODE> typically).</LI>
        <LI>calls where the module is fixed but the function is not are no
          longer unresolved; instead the "function" <CODE>'$F_EXPR'</CODE>
          is "called".</LI>
        <LI><CODE>xref_compiler:format_error/1</CODE> has been improved.</LI>
        <LI>bug fix: calls to <CODE>'MNEMOSYNE RULE'</CODE> et al removed.
        </LI>
        <LI><CODE>m/1</CODE> and <CODE>d/1</CODE> return a list that always
          contains two elements.</LI>
        <LI><CODE>xref_parser:t2s/1</CODE> adds quotes to atoms that need
          them.</LI>
        <LI>the documentation is less incomplete and buggy.</LI>
        <LI>the strict operator has been documented (it was present in the
          code before).</LI>

<H2>Tools 1.6</H2>
  <H3>Known Problems</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Externally defined macros are not handled correctly in Coast.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3273<BR>

    </LI>
  </UL>

  <H3>Fixed Errors and Malfunctions</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI><CODE>make:all()</CODE> no longer unnecessarily recompiles modules located in other directories than the current working directory.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3336<BR>
      Aux Id: Seq 4055
    </LI>
    <LI>When waiting for a reply from the Coast server process, the user interface functions did a <CODE>receive</CODE> that accepted any term. The <CODE>receive</CODE> has now been restricted to accept only the correct replies and not accidently a message from some other process.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3394<BR>
      Aux Id: Seq 4209
    </LI>
    <LI><CODE>coast:compile_all/1,2</CODE> now returns the correct return value <CODE>{error,Reason}</CODE> if the directory given as argument does not exist or cannot be read.<BR>
      Own Id: OTP-3500<BR>
      Aux Id: Seq 4394
    </LI>
    <LI>The function <CODE>instrument:memory_data/0</CODE> returned invalid information if an address or size exceeded 2^27. <CODE>instrument:store_memory_data</CODE> did not have that problem.<BR>

      Aux Id: seq1645, seq4228
    </LI>
    <LI>The eprof module has been optimised to minimise the measuring overhead. Typically, the measured program runs at about 50% of its ordinary speed.<BR>
