<H2>Kernel 2.6.2</H2>
<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>inet_res:nslookup/4</CODE> has been made backwards compatible.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3763<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4972

<LI>
When R6 nodes and unpatched R7 nodes are in the same
network, <CODE>global:register_name</CODE> hangs. This is fixed
with a patch to R7. Patched R7 nodes can communicate with
unpatched R7 nodes.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3714

<LI>
A hanging bug in the protocol between dist_ac and
application_controller has been fixed. It occurred
when dist_ac had stopped an application with 
{ac_change_application_req,AppName,stop_it} and then
tried to start it with {ac_change_application_req,
AppName,{takeover,FromNode,RestartType}}.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3773<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4996


<LI>
If a new application was added using code:replace_path/2,
the code:lib_dir/1 function would fail on the new application
name. This has been corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3780<br>
Aux Id: Seq 5003


<LI>
The internal inet_db counter next_id did not keep within
the bounds [0, 65535] imposed by DNS query field width.
The reply was then not recognized since the reply
id was truncated to 16 bits. This bug is now fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3798<br>
Aux Id: Seq 5001


<LI>
The default receive buffer size for UDP has been 
restored to 8192 bytes, which it was before R7.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3807<br>
Aux Id: OTP-3797


<LI>
gen_upd:recv/2,3 now works better. The option 
combination [binary, {active, false}] was broken.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3823


<LI>
A bug in efile_drv that randomly caused memory access 
violation when using file:get_cwd() has been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3832


<LI>
gen_tcp:connect/3,4, and gen_udp:send/4 now exits with 
badarg if an IP address tuple with a field
integer value that is is not in the range 0 through 
255 is passed as argument. Previously this caused a 
function clause.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3836<br>
Aux Id: Seq 5091


<LI>
The function inet:gethostbyname/2,3 sometimes returned
{error, timeout} when failing to lookup a name. This
has been changed to the more appropriate response
{error, nxdomain}.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3883


<LI>
The function inet:gethostbyname/2,3 now accepts an
IP-string as the Name argument for all resolver
types. This previously did not work for the built in
DNS resolver, nor for the /etc/hosts file resolver.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3886


<LI>
The native version of the resolver for erlang no longer may 
crash the system due to external causes like catatonic DNS 
servers.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3887


<LI>
When a host machine was misconfigured so that 
inet:gethostbyname/1 returned an empty hostname
for the host on which an erlang node was started, 
inet_config crashed with a function clause during node 
start on some platforms. This has now been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3894<br>
Aux Id: Seq 5127


<LI>
A close of a tcp socket could be delayed up to 5
seconds after all pending output had been sent. Now
the socket is closed immediately after all pending
output has been sent.

</UL>
<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>disk_log</CODE> handles huge terms better when reading
log files using <CODE>chunk/2</CODE>. Bugs in
<CODE>chunk/2</CODE> and <CODE>chunk_step/3</CODE> as well as in
<CODE>wrap_log_reader</CODE> have been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3716

<LI>
A number of bug fixes and improvements have been done
to applications <CODE>runtime_tools</CODE>, 
<CODE>kernel</CODE> and <CODE>erts</CODE>:
<UL>
<br>
<LI>A read timeout no longer resets the sequential
trace token. This is an incompatibility towards
the previous behaviour. Use
<CODE>seq_trace:set_token([])</CODE> to reset the
sequential trace token.
<br>
<LI><CODE>seq_trace:get_token/0</CODE> and 
<CODE>seq_trace:set_token/1</CODE> now have compatible
token formats. 
<br>
<LI><CODE>dbg:trace_port/2</CODE> and 
<CODE>dbg:trace_client/2,3</CODE> now supports trace
to and read from a size limited "wrap file set".
<br>
<LI><CODE>dbg:trace_port_control/1</CODE> now supports
operation <CODE>get_listen_port</CODE> for the ip
trace driver.
<br>
<LI>New match spec functions 
<CODE>{is_seq_trace}</CODE> and 
<CODE>{get_seq_trace}</CODE> has been added to test
and read the sequential trace token in match specs.
<br>
<LI>New match spec functions 
<CODE>{get_tcw}</CODE> and 
<CODE>{set_tcw Value}</CODE> that reads and sets 
a "trace control word" in the node has been added.
The "trace control word" is a word in each
Erlang node of at least 24 bits.
There are also enhancements of BIFs:
<CODE>erlang:system_info(trace_control_word)</CODE> and
<CODE>erlang:system_flag(trace_control_word, Value)</CODE>
for the same purpose.
<br>
<LI>A new match spec function
<CODE>{silent, TrueOrFalse}</CODE> for setting a 
silent call trace flag per process that inhibits
call trace messages, both local and global, has
been added. The BIF 
<CODE>erlang:trace/3</CODE> has been extended to 
recognize the flag 'silent' to start a call
trace in silent mode.
<br>
<LI>Some bugs in the <CODE>dbg</CODE> module has been
fixed, e.g the 'old_trace_call' flag has been
removed from the 'all' flags list, and the dbg server
no longer hangs if the supplied tracer fails to
start.
<br>
<LI>A bug in the emulator that made 'EXIT' messages
from a process involved in a sequential call trace
get overwritten by the sequential trace token
itself has been fixed.
<br>
<LI>The documentation regarding the above has
been updated. Especially, the fact that the match spec
function <CODE>{return_trace}</CODE> destroys the 
tail recursiveness of the traced function has been 
pointed out.
<br>
</UL>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3747<br>
Aux Id: OTP-3592, OTP-3744

<LI>
Hidden nodes and hidden global groups have been
introduced. This makes it possible to establish hidden
connections between Erlang nodes. See <code>global_group(3)</code>,
and <code>erl(1)</code>.

Aux Id: OTP-3916

</UL>

<H2>Kernel 2.6.1 (R7B)</H2>
<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
A new better and more portable hash BIF, <c>erlang:phash/2</c>, has been
introduced. The <c>dets</c> module will use the <c>erlang:phash/2</c>
for newly created tables. To rebuild an old table and start to use the
new hash BIF, give the <c>{repair,force}</c> option to <c>dets:open_file/2</c>.
See the documentation.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3397

<LI>
In OTP R7A, command line arguments could not be longer than
255 characters. This restriction has been removed again, but
since the length limit on atoms is enforced more thoroughly
than in earlier releases, <CODE>init:get_args/0</CODE> will fail
for such arguments. A new function
<CODE>init:get_plain_arguments/0</CODE> has been introduced,
which returns strings, and should be used instead.
The same problem with the command line flag <CODE>-s</CODE> is
solved by the introduction of a new command line flag
<CODE>-run</CODE>
with the same semantics as <CODE>-s</CODE>, except that the
user's function is called with a list of strings instead
of a list of atoms.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3687


</UL>
<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
On Unix, <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> previously used a dedicated
subprocess, which meant that calls to <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> were
serialized. This is no longer the case.
(For R7A users: the solution in R7A was too simple;
compatibility with earlier releases has been restored.)
The kernel configuration parameter <CODE>start_os</CODE> has
been removed.
<br>(*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)
<br>Own Id: OTP-3466<br>
Aux Id: seq4333


<LI>
A new callback <CODE>Mod:prep_stop/1</CODE> has been introduced
in <CODE>application</CODE>, for actions that need to be performed
before the children are terminated.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3590<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4578


<LI>
<CODE>disk_log</CODE>: <CODE>lclose/2</CODE> is a new function.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3685


<LI>
When supplying option {packet, PacketType} to
gen_udp:open(Portnum, Options) it now exits with badarg.
In previous releases this option was silently ignored,
which was too forgiving since UDP datagrams 
are packets by definition, and hence this option
was obsolete. Furthermore, the more exotic 
PacketType values, e.g. asn1, cdr, sunrm, fcgi, 
has never been implemented for UDP. 
Programs that supply this obsolete option 
to gen_udp:open/2 will probably crash
when running on this release.

If more than 1024 bytes of text (more than 256 in release R4)
are pasted into the shell, and this text consists of
more than one expression sequence (each ending with a period),
text after the first 1024 bytes may be lost.

<LI>
If an error occurred when accessing a file, the file
process died, and further attempts to access the file
could cause the caller to hang. Now, it will no longer
hang, but return <CODE>{error, terminated}</CODE>.
<br>Own Id: OTP-1400<br>

controller were corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3380<br>

Aux Id: Seq 4274


<LI>
<CODE>rpc:multicall</CODE> could leave a <CODE>nodedown</CODE> message

Aux Id: seq4354, seq4259


<LI>
After using <CODE>erlang:demonitor/1</CODE> on a remote process,
a <CODE>DOWN</CODE> message would appear anyway if the remote
node went down. This has been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3499<br>

<LI>
<CODE>global:register_name</CODE> and similar functions could
sometimes fail to modify the names consistently on all nodes,
if new nodes appeared in the network during the operation.

If a partly partitioned net is brought together again,
<CODE>global</CODE> could enter deadlock.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3575<br>
Aux Id: OTP-2766


<LI>
In a net which had been partly partitioned and brought
together again, it could happen that the name registry
would remain inconsistent indefinitely.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3576


<LI>
When starting up a configured network, a deadlock could
occur, especially if the nodes were much different in
speed. This has been fixed.

<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
When several versions of an application existed 
simultaneously in the lib directory, the code server
did not neccessarily pick the latest version of the
application case any version number was greater than 
9, when in interactive mode (for instance, 1.9 was
considered later that 1.10).
<br>Own Id: OTP-2976


<LI>
Documentation for the function application:get_key/1/2
has been improved.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3379<br>
Aux Id: seq4164


<LI>
On Unix, <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> previously used a dedicated
subprocess, which meant that calls to <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> were
serialized. This is no longer the case.
<br>(*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)
<br>Own Id: OTP-3466<br>
Aux Id: seq4333


<LI>
The <CODE>disk_log</CODE> module has been improved as regards
distribution. The value returned from <CODE>open/1</CODE> when
opening a distributed log has been modified. The modification
is incompatible with the previously returned value. Attempts
to open a distributed log on a node running new code from
a node running old code, and vice versa, results in a
<CODE>nodedown</CODE> error message.
<CODE>info/1</CODE> returns two more tags, 'node' and 'distributed'.
The new	function <CODE>lclose/1</CODE> closes a log on the current 
node. The layout of the continuation returned from
<CODE>chunk{_step}</CODE> has	been changed, 
and the new function <CODE>chunk_info/1</CODE>
returns the node where chunks are read from. The new
function <CODE>accessible_logs/0</CODE> returns the names
of disk logs accessible on the current node.

<LI>
The BIF erlang:monitor(process, Proc) has been extended
to accept named processes, local and remote. 
See the documentation for erlang:monitor/2 and 
erlang:demonitor/1.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3657


<LI>
The gen_ family (mostly gen_server and gen_fsm)
and rpc has been rewritten to use the new BIF
erlang:monitor/2 as much as possible. This should
improve performance and remove some possibilities 
of hanging gen_server calls. In particular, 
gen_server:multi_call/2..4 and 
rpc:multi_server_call/2,3 should now never hang,
at least not when all nodes are of this
release. See also the documentation for 
gen_server and rpc.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3660


<LI>
The inet driver (inet_drv, i.e the driver for 
(TCP&UDP)/IP) and a lot of supporting Erlang 
code in the application kernel, has been replaced.
The new code, courtesy of Tony Rogvall,
eliminates one data relay process per socket
and thereby gives a throughput boost.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3661


<LI>
For completeness, a new function 
rpc:nb_yield/2 has been added. 
See the documentation.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3662


<LI>
The <CODE>erlang:info/1</CODE> and <CODE>erlang:system_info/1</CODE> BIFs have been
merged into one. The recommended way to use the combined
BIF is by the name <CODE>erlang:system_info/1</CODE>, but
<CODE>erlang:info/1</CODE> will also work.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3669


<LI>
There is a new os:getenv/0 function that retrieves a list
of all (operating system) environment variables.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3670


<LI>
New socket options for TCP/IP sockets: 
'tpkt' and 'line'. See the documentation for 
inet:setopts/2.

<LI>
Most of the previously undocumented BIFs in the <CODE>erlang</CODE>
module have been documented. Still undocumented are BIFs
which are of no use in applications, for instance the set
of BIFs	used to implement the distribution protocol.
The newly documented BIFs are:

The new BIF term_to_binary/2 can be used for automatically
compressing the external representation of an Erlang term.
The binary_to_term/1 BIF in R7 automatically recognises
and decompresses such compressed terms.

All kind of trace messages can now be sent to a port
instead of to a process (for less performance impact).
The <CODE>erlang:trace/3</CODE> BIF now accept an option to
set the tracer process or port.
The seq_trace:set_system_tracer/1 (for sequential tracing)
function now accepts a port identifier as well as a pid.
<p>
There are suitable drivers that can receive trace output
in the new <CODE>runtime_tools</CODE> application.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3236


<LI>
In order to support the new call tracing, several incompatible
changes have been made to the trace/3 BIF.
<p>
The trace/3 BIF is now longer auto-imported; it must be
called as erlang:trace/3 or imported.
<p>
The 'bifs' flag is no longer supported.  Bifs can be traced
as any exported function using the new call tracing
(see <CODE>erlang:trace_pattern/2</CODE>).
<p>
The 'suspend' flag is no longer supported.  Use the new
<CODE>erlang:suspend_process/1</CODE> and <CODE>erlang:resume_process/1</CODE>
Bifs instead.
<p>
The 'call' flag turns on new call tracing for a process.
Use the 'old_call_trace' to turn on the old-fashioned call
tracing.
<p>
There is no longer a restriction that process cannot trace
a process that is tracing another processs.  Therefore, it is
possible to construct a circle of processes that are tracing
each other (which is a bad idea beacuase the Erlang machine
will probably crasch).
<p>
The trace messages from send and receive traces have been
changed to make consistent with the other trace messages.
Now all trace messages have the pid of the traced process in
position 2 and the type of trace in position 3.
<p>
If timestamps are enabled, the first element of each trace
message tuple will be 'trace_ts'.
<p>
The return value is no longer 'true', but the number of processes
that matched the process argument.  For instance, the return value
will be '1' if an explicit Pid argument was given.

<LI>
A new kind of call tracing has been added.  The new call
tracing only support tracing of external function calls,
but there is no need to trace-compile the modules to be
traced.
<p>
The <CODE>erlang:trace/3</CODE> has been changed and extended
to support the new call tracing.  It is also possible
to set the default tracer and trace flags for all
new processes that are or created.  There is also a new
option to explicitly pass the pid of the tracer process.
Also, trace messages can be sent to a port for less
performance impact.
<p>
There are two new Bifs: <CODE>erlang:trace_pattern/2</CODE>
to enable tracing on certain conditions for one or more
exported functions or Bifs, <CODE>erlang:trace_info/2</CODE>
to retrieve trace information about a process or exported
function.

EXIT codes now contains more information about where the
error occured.  There used to be only an indication of the
current function; now the complete call chain is included
in the EXIT code.

There are two new Bifs similar to exit/1, except that
they generate information about which in function the fault
occurred.  The Bifs are <CODE>erlang:fault/1</CODE> and
<CODE>erlang:fault/2</CODE>.

The new notification <CODE>{format_external,</CODE> Items<CODE>}</CODE>
is generated when <CODE>alog/2</CODE> or <CODE>alog_terms/2</CODE>
is used with an internal log.
The new function <CODE>info/1</CODE> returns information about a

The <CODE>disk_log</CODE> module has been changed according to the
following. Requests to close a disk log are always granted. 
The disk log is unblocked if the blocking process closes 
the disk log. Any other process just closes the log. If a 
process that is linked to a disk log terminates, this
is handled exactly as if the process had closed the log
and then terminated. If any other process than the blocking 
one tries to unblock a log, 
<CODE>{error, {not_blocked_by_pid, Name}}</CODE> is returned.
The exit messages returned by open and reopen have been
changed.

the delay time before the hardware watchdog (if any) is
triggered. This is used to reserve time for closing down the
system in a proper way without interference from the watchdog.
Both variables can have values in seconds and must be in the 
range 10 < x <= 65535. If the variable(s) are not set the
default value is 60 seconds for both timeouts.
