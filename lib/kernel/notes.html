<h2>Kernel 2.8.0</h2>


<!--- ----------------------------------------------------------------- --->

<h3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    A race condition in dist_ac has been removed. <br> The documentation
    didn't clearly state that all distributed applications depend on (at
    least) kernel and stdlib (kernel and stdlib should be part of
    "applications" in the .app file). This has now been added to the app(4)
    manual page. <br> The following has also been changed in the system
    documentation (not shipped with patches): PREVIOUSLY: When distributed
    applications are specified, it is advised that the sync_nodes
    functionality in the kernel application is used. If not used, and
    several nodes are started at the same time, the node that comes up
    first will start all applications, and the other nodes will take over
    the applications when they come up. <br> NOW: When distributed
    applications are specified, it is required that the sync_nodes
    functionality in the kernel application (see kernel(6)) is used to
    synchronize all involved nodes. If not used, the distribution mechanism
    for distributed applications will not function correctly.<br>

  </li>

  <li>
    The spawn bifs didn't fail with badarg as they should if the argument
    list wasn't a list; instead, the spawned process immediately exited.
    All spawn BIFs now fail with badarg if they are passed a bad argument
    as argument list. <br> spawn BIFs which take funs as arguments and
    remote spawn BIFs could fail with other errors than badarg when passed
    bad arguments. All spawn BIFs now fail with badarg when they fail due
    to bad arguments.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4185)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    A bug in <code>disk_log:unblock/1</code> that could cause messages to
    be processed in wrong order has been fixed. Write errors no longer
    terminate the disk log process.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4191)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The application module list is now properly updated after a code
    change.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4342)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    A deadlock could occur if distributed disk logs were opened
    simultaneously on different nodes. This bug has been fixed.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4405)<br>
    (Aux Id: seq7275)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    os:find_executable/1 would return wrong return values ({ok,Name} or
    error) if given an absolute path name instead of the documented values
    (Name or false).<br>
    (*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)<br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Improvements and new features</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    The spawn_opt/[2,3,5] BIFs has been added. That is, spawn_opts that
    takes a fun as argument, and spawn_opts that spawn a process on a
    remote node.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4180)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The sasl application variable 'log_utc' can be set to 'true' to make
    ordinary sasl logs as well as report browser output appear with
    Universal Coordinated Time instead of local time.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4245)<br>
    (Aux Id: Seq7242)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The set_net_ticktime/[1,2] and get_net_ticktime/0 functions has been
    added to the net_kernel module (see net_kernel(3)) which makes it
    possible to change the net_tick time during operation.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4255)<br>
    (Aux Id: SEQ-7249)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    There are new functions <code>bchunk/2,3</code> in the
    <code>disk_log</code> module that are to be used like
    <code>chunk/2,3</code> but return objects as binaries.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4327)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The loading of BEAM code at start-up of embedded systems has been
    optimized: if the thread pool is non-empty (see the system flag
    <code>+A</code> in <code>erl(3)</code>) and files are read from a file
    system (the default, see the value <code>efile</code> of the
    <code>-loader</code> flag in <code>erl(3)</code>) disk seek times have
    been reduced.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4372)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    There is a new configuration parameter 'shutdown_func' to application
    kernel that allows you to register a function to be called when
    application_controller shuts down. See the man page for 'kernel'.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4424)<br>
    (Aux Id: seq7520)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The module 'erlang' is now preloaded. Customized start scripts have to
    be rebuilt.<br>
    (*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4433)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The option <code>compressed</code> to <code>file:open/2</code> has now
    been documented.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4513)<p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Kernel 2.8.0</h2>


<!--- ----------------------------------------------------------------- --->

<h3>Known problems</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    <code>code:is_loaded/1</code> doesn't type check its arguments.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-2607)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    If more than 1024 bytes of text are pasted into the shell, and this
    text consists of more than one expression sequence (each ending with a
    period), text after the first 1024 bytes may be lost.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-3041)<p>
  </li>

</ul>


There are also release notes for
