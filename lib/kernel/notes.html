<H2>Kernel 2.6.1 (R7B)</H2>
<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
A new better and more portable hash BIF, <c>erlang:phash/2</c>, has been
introduced. The <c>dets</c> module will use the <c>erlang:phash/2</c>
for newly created tables. To rebuild an old table and start to use the
new hash BIF, give the <c>{repair,force}</c> option to <c>dets:open_file/2</c>.
See the documentation.

<LI>
In OTP R7A, command line arguments could not be longer than
255 characters. This restriction has been removed again, but
since the length limit on atoms is enforced more thoroughly
than in earlier releases, <CODE>init:get_args/0</CODE> will fail
for such arguments. A new function
<CODE>init:get_plain_arguments/0</CODE> has been introduced,
which returns strings, and should be used instead.
The same problem with the command line flag <CODE>-s</CODE> is
solved by the introduction of a new command line flag
<CODE>-run</CODE>
with the same semantics as <CODE>-s</CODE>, except that the
user's function is called with a list of strings instead
of a list of atoms.

<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
On Unix, <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> previously used a dedicated
subprocess, which meant that calls to <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> were
serialized. This is no longer the case.
(For R7A users: the solution in R7A was too simple;
compatibility with earlier releases has been restored.)
The kernel configuration parameter <CODE>start_os</CODE> has
been removed.

<LI>
A new callback <CODE>Mod:prep_stop/1</CODE> has been introduced
in <CODE>application</CODE>, for actions that need to be performed
before the children are terminated.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3590<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4578


<LI>
<CODE>disk_log</CODE>: <CODE>lclose/2</CODE> is a new function.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3685


<LI>
When supplying option {packet, PacketType} to
gen_udp:open(Portnum, Options) it now exits with badarg.
In previous releases this option was silently ignored,
which was too forgiving since UDP datagrams 
are packets by definition, and hence this option
was obsolete. Furthermore, the more exotic 
PacketType values, e.g. asn1, cdr, sunrm, fcgi, 
has never been implemented for UDP. 
Programs that supply this obsolete option 
to gen_udp:open/2 will probably crash
when running on this release.

<H2>Kernel 2.6 (R7A)</H2>
<H3>Known problems</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>code:is_loaded/1</CODE> doesn't type check its arguments.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2607


<LI>
If more than 1024 bytes of text (more than 256 in release R4)
are pasted into the shell, and this text consists of
more than one expression sequence (each ending with a period),
text after the first 1024 bytes may be lost.

<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
If an error occurred when accessing a file, the file
process died, and further attempts to access the file
could cause the caller to hang. Now, it will no longer
hang, but return <CODE>{error, terminated}</CODE>.
<br>Own Id: OTP-1400<br>
Aux Id: OTP-1034, OTP-2400


<LI>
Using <code>gen_tcp:send</code> on a closed socket no
longer causes the caller to hang.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2714<br>
Aux Id: seq 1122

<LI>
A few problems having to do with start phases in the application
controller were corrected.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3380<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4166


<LI>
<CODE>net_adm:names</CODE> always returned the empty list.
This is now corrected. A similar error was corrected
in inet_db.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3432<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4274


<LI>
<CODE>rpc:multicall</CODE> could leave a <CODE>nodedown</CODE> message
in the caller's message queue under some circumstances.
This has been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3449<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4305


<LI>
A fix in the <CODE>disk_log</CODE> module: changing the size of a 
non-full wrap log could return the error <CODE>einval</CODE>.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3484<br>
Aux Id: seq4354, seq4259


<LI>
After using <CODE>erlang:demonitor/1</CODE> on a remote process,
a <CODE>DOWN</CODE> message would appear anyway if the remote
node went down. This has been fixed.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3499<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4393


<LI>
<CODE>global:register_name</CODE> and similar functions could
sometimes fail to modify the names consistently on all nodes,
if new nodes appeared in the network during the operation.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3552<br>
Aux Id: Seq 4490


<LI>
If a partly partitioned net is brought together again,
<CODE>global</CODE> could enter deadlock.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3575<br>
Aux Id: OTP-2766


<LI>
In a net which had been partly partitioned and brought
together again, it could happen that the name registry
would remain inconsistent indefinitely.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3576


<LI>
When starting up a configured network, a deadlock could
occur, especially if the nodes were much different in
speed. This has been fixed.

<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
When several versions of an application existed 
simultaneously in the lib directory, the code server
did not neccessarily pick the latest version of the
application case any version number was greater than 
9, when in interactive mode (for instance, 1.9 was
considered later that 1.10).
<br>Own Id: OTP-2976


<LI>
Documentation for the function application:get_key/1/2
has been improved.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3379<br>
Aux Id: seq4164


<LI>
On Unix, <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> previously used a dedicated
subprocess, which meant that calls to <CODE>os:cmd/1</CODE> were
serialized. This is no longer the case.
<br>(*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***)
<br>Own Id: OTP-3466<br>
Aux Id: seq4333


<LI>
The <CODE>disk_log</CODE> module has been improved as regards
distribution. The value returned from <CODE>open/1</CODE> when
opening a distributed log has been modified. The modification
is incompatible with the previously returned value. Attempts
to open a distributed log on a node running new code from
a node running old code, and vice versa, results in a
<CODE>nodedown</CODE> error message.
<CODE>info/1</CODE> returns two more tags, 'node' and 'distributed'.
The new	function <CODE>lclose/1</CODE> closes a log on the current 
node. The layout of the continuation returned from
<CODE>chunk{_step}</CODE> has	been changed, 
and the new function <CODE>chunk_info/1</CODE>
returns the node where chunks are read from. The new
function <CODE>accessible_logs/0</CODE> returns the names
of disk logs accessible on the current node.

<LI>
The BIF erlang:monitor(process, Proc) has been extended
to accept named processes, local and remote. 
See the documentation for erlang:monitor/2 and 
erlang:demonitor/1.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3657


<LI>
The gen_ family (mostly gen_server and gen_fsm)
and rpc has been rewritten to use the new BIF
erlang:monitor/2 as much as possible. This should
improve performance and remove some possibilities 
of hanging gen_server calls. In particular, 
gen_server:multi_call/2..4 and 
rpc:multi_server_call/2,3 should now never hang,
at least not when all nodes are of this
release. See also the documentation for 
gen_server and rpc.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3660


<LI>
The inet driver (inet_drv, i.e the driver for 
(TCP&UDP)/IP) and a lot of supporting Erlang 
code in the application kernel, has been replaced.
The new code, courtesy of Tony Rogvall,
eliminates one data relay process per socket
and thereby gives a throughput boost.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3661


<LI>
For completeness, a new function 
rpc:nb_yield/2 has been added. 
See the documentation.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3662


<LI>
The <CODE>erlang:info/1</CODE> and <CODE>erlang:system_info/1</CODE> BIFs have been
merged into one. The recommended way to use the combined
BIF is by the name <CODE>erlang:system_info/1</CODE>, but
<CODE>erlang:info/1</CODE> will also work.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3669


<LI>
There is a new os:getenv/0 function that retrieves a list
of all (operating system) environment variables.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3670


<LI>
New socket options for TCP/IP sockets: 
'tpkt' and 'line'. See the documentation for 
inet:setopts/2.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3674


<LI>
Most of the previously undocumented BIFs in the <CODE>erlang</CODE>
module have been documented. Still undocumented are BIFs
which are of no use in applications, for instance the set
of BIFs	used to implement the distribution protocol.
The newly documented BIFs are:
<br>
<CODE>append_element/2</CODE>,
<CODE>bump_reductions/1</CODE>,
<CODE>display/1</CODE>,
<CODE>function_exported/3</CODE>,
<CODE>garbage_collect/0,1</CODE>,
<CODE>is_builtin/3</CODE>,
<CODE>loaded/0</CODE>,
<CODE>make_tuple/2</CODE>,
<CODE>md5/1</CODE>,
<CODE>md5_final/1</CODE>,
<CODE>md5_init/1</CODE>,
<CODE>md5_update/2</CODE>,
<CODE>port_close/1</CODE>,
<CODE>port_command/2</CODE>,
<CODE>port_connect/2</CODE>,
<CODE>port_control/3</CODE>,
<CODE>port_to_list/1</CODE>,
<CODE>ref_to_list/1</CODE>,
<CODE>system_info/1</CODE>, and
<CODE>yield/0</CODE>.

<LI>
The new BIF term_to_binary/2 can be used for automatically
compressing the external representation of an Erlang term.
The binary_to_term/1 BIF in R7 automatically recognises
and decompresses such compressed terms.
