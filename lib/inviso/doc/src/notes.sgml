	    A bug in inviso_rt_meta caused an ETS table containing
	    information on initiated (init_tpm) functions to be lost
	    when suspending tracing. Further an enhancement to
	    inviso_rt has been introduced making it possible to
	    activate process trace flags based on globally registered
	    names. It is then not an error to activate a global name
	    on a node where the name does not reside. The process
	    count in the return value will simply be set to zero
	    (hence exactly one node in the NodeResult part of the
	    return value will indicate one matching process found). A
	    bug was found in fetch_log API. At the same time the
	    fetch_log functionality was enhanced to also offer flow
	    control making fetcher processes send chunks of
	    transferred file data at a slower pace.</p>

            This ticket includes several improvements and bugfixes to
            both runtime_tools and inviso. The overload mechanism can
            now also react to incomming messages. This is useful if
            an external overload watch-dog is used. Some improvements
            of variable bindings has been done to the default
            autostart mechanism - inviso_autostart_server. Autostart
            "jobs" can now be done in paralell, allowing for some
            jobs to hang waiting for some parts of the traced system
            to become ready before proceeding. Previously when using
            named meta-match-specs (tpm_ms) ending up with zero
            match-specs still kept the meta trace pattern active.
            This caused zero match-specs to be equal to unlimited
            meta tracing on that particular function. If the internal
            database becomes empty of meta match specs, meta trace
            pattern is removed for that function. Standard public
            loop data in the inviso runtime meta tracer process is
            now extended to a 2-tuple. The functions ctp/1 and ctpl/1
            are added making it possible to remove trace patterns for
            a list of functions rather than one by one.
            Inviso_rt_meta will now accept a list of binaries to be
            output into the trace information file, in additions to a
            single binary. Further it is also possible to make own
            output to the trace information file using the write_ti/1
            function. An error was discovered in inviso_rt making the
            inviso_rt_meta remain rather than terminate if the
            inviso_rt terminated due to "running alone" (not allowed
            to run without a control component). A new tool,
            inviso_tool, has been added to the inviso application.</p>
