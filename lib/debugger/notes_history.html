<h2>Debugger 1.5.4</h2>

<h3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Debugger crashed when trying to save or load settings if the default
    directory <code>$HOME/.erlang_tools/debugger</code> had restricted
    access.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-3244)<br>
    (Aux Id: seq3852 in supportsystem)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The debugger can now handle bit syntax construction in guards.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-3741)<p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improvements and new features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Code has been cleared up to get rid of compiler warnings.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-3728)<p>
  </li>

  <li>
    The debugger now uses debugged information in beam files, instead of
    compiling the modules to be debugged. That implies modules to be
    debugged must be compiled beforehand and they must be compiled with
    <code>debug_info</code> option. Also, there is no need to set any
    include paths (because no compilation is done). The source code is
    still needed for display purposes. <br> <p>The record editor has been
    removed, as record names are no longer known by the debugger.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-4151)<p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The "Interpret Dialog" window hangs if one tries to debug-compile a
    module residing in a sticky directory.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-2665)<p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Included source code is not shown in the "Attached Process" window.<br>
    (Own Id: OTP-3579)<p>
  </li>
</ul>


<H2>Debugger 1.5.3</H2>
<H3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</H3>

<LI>
The debugger could not be run in embedded mode, because the
dbg_ets module was not listed in the app file.
<br>Own Id: OTP-3829<br>

<LI>
In some cases, the debugger would in a call to undefined
function <CODE>erts_debug:apply/4</CODE>. This problem has been
corrected.

<H2>Source Debugger 1.0.3</H2>
  <H3>Improvements and New Features</H3>
  <P>This debugger is the only option on the Windows platform. To use this new debugger instead of the old <STRONG>interpreter</STRONG> on Unix you start erlang with the command line option <CODE>-new_debugger</CODE>.</P>

  <H3>Fixed Errors and Malfunctions</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>The debugger is now an Erlang application, i.e. it has an application file.<BR>

      Own Id: OTP-1963
    </LI>
    <LI>You can't give an search path in the graphical interface where to look for include files. As a work around you can define the file/module to debug/interpret from the Erlang shell and give the search path as an option. To debug/interpret the module <CODE>foo</CODE> that contains the include directive <CODE>-include(&#34;bar.hrl&#34;).</CODE> in the directory &#34;/my/include/dir&#34; you can do one of:
      <PRE>
1&#62; ii(foo,[{i,&#34;/my/include/dir&#34;}]).
2&#62; int:i(foo,[{i,&#34;/my/include/dir&#34;}]).
      </PRE>
      You can define a macro as well:
      <PRE>
3&#62; ii(foo,[{d,bar,42}]).
      </PRE>

    </LI>
    <LI>B. It is now possible to set a default back trace value either global for all new attached processes, or locally, for already attached processes, and view the back trace functions in the trace frame.
    </LI>
  </UL>

  <H3>Fixed Errors and Malfunctions</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Fixed problems caused by break points on auto attach whenever there where more than 1000 lines of code in the module. Fixed bug caused by auto attach when distributed.

<H2>Source Debugger 1.0</H2>
<P> The Source Debugger is a new graphical application based on GS. It is actually a new graphical front end to the old source debugger, the <STRONG>Interpreter</STRONG>. See the <STRONG>Source Debugger User's Guide</STRONG>.</P>
