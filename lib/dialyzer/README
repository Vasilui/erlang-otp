-- Starting the Dialyzer
--
-----------------------------------------------

You can use Dialyzer either in its GUI mode, simply by:

	./dialyzer

or in its command-line mode, as e.g. by:

	./dialyzer -r OTP_DIR/lib/inets

which analyzes all the bytecode (.beam) files of the "inets" application of
the Erlang/OTP installation for discrepancies.

The complete set of Dialyzer options is:

	dialyzer [--help] [--version] [--shell] [--plt plt]
                 [-pa dir]* [-Ddefine]* [-I include_dir]* [-Wwarn]*
                 [--src] [-c applications] [-r applications] [-o outfile] [-q]

Use "./dialyzer --help" to see an explanation of these options.


The Persistent Lookup Table
===========================
Dialyzer comes with a Persistent Lookup Table containing type information
for functions in some of the Erlang/OTP standard libraries. This table is
the starting point for later analyses. At each startup of Dialyzer the
validity of this PLT is checked, and if something has changed in the OTP
libraries, a new PLT will be constructed.

It is possible to setup user-specified PLTs.
