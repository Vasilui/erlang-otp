	  <p>
	    Dialyzer's analysis is significantly faster as it uses a global function
	    call-graph for obtaining type signatures for all analyzed functions.

  <section><title>Dialyzer 1.3.0</title>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Fixed a number of false positives that Dialyzer 1.2.0 was spitting out.
	  </p>
	</item>
      </list>
    </section>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Requires the presence of an Erlang/OTP R10B-4 system.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Dialyzer is significantly (approx 40%) faster since it now uses 'ets'
	    rather than 'dets' for its PLT.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Slightly improved the precision of the analysis.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    In the GUI version, Dialyzer now reports the list of modules that should
	    be included in the modules to analyze in order to possibly improve
	    the accuracy of the reported results.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Some more information is displayed when calling a function or closure
	    with arguments of the wrong type.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    The record guard now allows discrepancies involving tuples that are known
	    to be records to be displayed as #rec{} rather than {'rec',_,...,_}
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Added -q option which makes the command-line version of Dialyzer
	    a bit more silent.

  <section><title>Dialyzer 1.2.0</title>
      
    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Dialyzer works with the open source and commercial versions of Erlang/OTP
	    R10B-2 on all platforms (i.e., HiPE support is not a prerequisite anymore).
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Whenever a .beam file contains abstract code (i.e., has been compiled
	    with the +debug_info option), the analysis starts from this code rather
	    than from BEAM bytecode -- this makes the results identical to those
	    obtained by analysis starting from source code.
	    (This is a contribution from Bjorn Gustavsson - Thanks!)
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Added -pa command line option for easier handling of -include_lib()
	    directives in source code.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Includes all changes added in v1.1.1; see below.  The "Add Recursively"
	    functionality is also available in the command-line mode (-r option).

	  <p>
	    The command-line mode of Dialyzer spits discrepancies in stdout
	    by default and returns a numeric value indicating its exit status.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Added "Add Recursively" button contributed by Martin Bjorklund (thanks!).

  <section><title>Dialyzer 1.1.0</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Dialyzer works with the open source version of Erlang/OTP R10B-1 (on
	    platforms where HiPE support is available) and it does not require
	    installation of a customized Erlang/OTP system anymore.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Dialyzer comes with an extensive command-line interface, in addition
	    to an enhanced GUI.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Analysis can start from source code (through Core Erlang) as well as
	    from BEAM bytecode.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Dialyzer finds considerably more discrepancies in Erlang code than
	    previous versions.
	  </p>
	</item>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Added ability to selectively turn on/off different warning categories.
	  </p>

  <section><title>Dialyzer 1.0.1</title>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Fixed major bug of v1.0.0 which caused the analysis to stop prematurely
	    (i.e., without properly reaching fixpoint) when analyzing more than one
	    module.  This did not affect correctness of the results, but lost many
	    opportunities to detect discrepancies.
	  </p>
	</item>
      </list>
    </section>
    
    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>

  <section><title>Dialyzer 1.0.0</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>
	    Initial Dialyzer version: Analysis starts from BEAM bytecode only and 
	    only a GUI version is available. Dialyzer reports discrepancies in the
	    use of the "sequential" part of Erlang. To be used, Dialyzer requires
	    the presence of a specific snapshot of Erlang/OTP which can be obtained
	    from Dialyzer's homepage.
