  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p><em>Dialyzer</em> is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies
      such as type errors, unreachable code, unnecessary tests, etc in single Erlang modules
      or entire (sets of) applications.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using the Dialyzer from the GUI</title>

    <section>
      <title>Choosing the applications or modules</title>
      <p>In the "File" window you will find a listing of the current directory.
        Click your way to the directories/modules you want to add or type the
        correct path in the entry.</p>
      <p>Mark the directories/modules you want to analyze for discrepancies and
        click "Add". You can either add the <c><![CDATA[.beam]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[.erl]]></c>-files directly, or
        you can add directories that contain these kinds of files. Note that
        you are only allowed to add the type of files that can be analyzed in
        the current mode of operation (see below), and that you cannot mix
        <c><![CDATA[.beam]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[.erl]]></c>-files.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The analysis modes</title>
      <p>Dialyzer has two modes of analysis, "Byte Code" or "Source Code". 
         These are controlled by the buttons in the top-middle part of the 
         main window, under "Analysis Options".</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Controlling the discrepancies reported by the Dialyzer</title>
      <p>Under the "Warnings" pull-down menu, there are buttons that control
        which discrepancies are reported to the user in the "Warnings" window.
        By clicking on these buttons, one can enable/disable a whole class of
        warnings.  Information about the classes of warnings can be found on
        the "Warnings" item under the "Help" menu (at the rightmost top corner).</p>
      <p>If modules are compiled with inlining, spurious warnings may be emitted.
        In the "Options" menu you can choose to ignore inline-compiled modules
        when analyzing byte code. When starting from source code this is not a
        problem since the inlining is explicitly turned off by Dialyzer. The
        option causes Dialyzer to suppress all warnings from inline-compiled
        modules, since there is currently no way for Dialyzer to find what
        parts of the code have been produced by inlining. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Running the analysis</title>
      <p>Once you have chosen the modules or directories you want to analyze,
        click the "Run" button to start the analysis. If for some reason you
        want to stop the analysis while it is running, push the "Stop" button.</p>
      <p>The information from the analysis will be displayed in the Log and the
        Warnings windows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Include directories and macro definitions</title>
      <p>When analyzing from source you might have to supply Dialyzer with a
        list of include directories and macro definitions (as you can do with
        the <c><![CDATA[erlc]]></c> flags <c><![CDATA[-I]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[-D]]></c>). This can be done either by starting Dialyzer
        with these flags from the command line as in:</p>
      <code type="none"><![CDATA[
\011./dialyzer -I my_includes -DDEBUG -Dvsn=42 -I one_more_dir
      ]]></code>
      <p>or by adding these explicitly using the "Manage Macro Definitions" or
        "Manage Include Directories" sub-menus in the "Options" menu.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Saving the information on the Log and Warnings windows</title>
      <p>In the "File" menu there are options to save the contents of the Log
        and the Warnings window. Just choose the options and enter the file to
        save the contents in.</p>
      <p>There are also buttons to clear the contents of each window.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Inspecting the inferred types of the analyzed functions</title>
      <p>Dialyzer stores the information of the analyzed functions in a
        Persistent Lookup Table (PLT). After an analysis you can inspect this
        information. In the PLT menu you can choose to either search the PLT
        or inspect the contents of the whole PLT. The information is presented
        in edoc format.</p>

  <section>
    <title>More on the Persistent Lookup Table (PLT)</title>
    <p>During setup, a Persistent Lookup Table will automatically be created
      for the Erlang/OTP libraries specified in <c><![CDATA[dialyzer/src/Makefile]]></c>. This
      table will be the starting point for later analyses. At each startup
      of Dialyzer the validity of the PLT will be checked, and if something
      has changed in the included libraries a new PLT will be constructed.</p>
    <p>To build a PLT of your own favorite files use the <c><![CDATA[--output_plt]]></c> option
      to specify where the file containing the PLT should be stored. At
      later analyses this PLT can be used as the starting point by using the
      <c><![CDATA[--plt]]></c> option. Note that the new PLT file also includes the information
      from the PLT that was used as the starting point</p>
    <p>In an Erlang/OTP system which has been installed, the user typically
      does not have write permission to the file of the PLT. If Dialyzer
      later finds that the PLT is not up-to-date, the analysis is aborted
      with a warning. Until the installed PLT has been updated a temporary
      PLT can be created and used in the manner described above. For 
      administrators that do have write permissions to the install directory, 
      a new plt can be built by using the --check_init_plt option.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Feedback and bug reports</title>
    <p>At this point, we very much welcome user feedback (even wish-lists!).
      If you notice something weird, especially if the Dialyzer reports any
      discrepancy that is a false positive, please send an error report
      describing the symptoms and how to reproduce them to:</p>
