The DIALYZER, a DIscrepany AnaLYZer for ERlang programs.

The Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies
such as type errors, unreachable code, unnecessary tests, etc in single Erlang
modules or entire (sets of) applications. Currently, Dialyzer starts its
analysis from either BEAM bytecode or from Erlang source code and reports
to its user the functions where the discrepancies occur and an indication
of what the discrepancy is about. Dialyzer currently supports various modes
of operation and its analysis is precise (in particular, there are no false
positives) and quite fast.

For more information on how to use the Dialyzer consult the "Manual" section
of the "Help" menu.


Planned Future Extensions
=========================
 1. Provide more precise information (e.g. line number) about the place
    where the discrepancies occur.
 2. Automatically annotate the programs with the inferred type information.
 3. Extend the analysis to the concurrent part of Erlang.
