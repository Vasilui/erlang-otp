<H3>Improvements and new features</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
The authentication modules have been rewritten with support for 
dets, plain and mnesia authentication databases. There is also
a new module called 'mod_secrity', which implements security
event logging and notification. Both the mod_auth and
mod_security modules have an API for the programmer that
implements functions they will require to have full control
over access restricted parts of a site.
NOTE: The mod_auth_mnesia module does not implement the API
previously found there, please see the mod_auth
documentation.

instead.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2848

header field.
<br>Own Id: OTP-2870

<br>Own Id: OTP-2915


<LI>

<br>Own Id: OTP-2982


<LI>
The HTTP server now experimentaly supports persistent connections (as defined in RFC2068). This is the first step towards HTTP/1.1 support. Enabling this feature may greatly improve performance, as the server then uses the same TCP connection for more than one HTTP request.
Two new configuration directives are defined for httpd_core:
KeepAlive  max-requests
KeepAliveTimeout  seconds
