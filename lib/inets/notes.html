</ul>

<h3>Fixed errors and malfunctions</h3>

<ul>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3627

<h2>

Status code 404 incorrectly used instead of 500.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3402
<li>
Handling of lack of resources (to many open files, ...) improved.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3403, OTP-3461
<li>
Use of obsolete and not recommended functions removed.</li>

<br>Functions httpd_conf:is_directory/1 and httpd_conf:is_file/1 has changed
so that when they are called with a path which is not a directory (in the
first case) or file (in the second case) then the return value will be
<i>{error,FileInfo},</i>
where FileInfo is now a file_info record according to <i>kernel/include/file.hrl.</i>
<br>Own Id: OTP-3405
<li>
Call of non-existing function 'inet:getaddr/1' in httpd_conf:load/2 Corrected.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3457

Call to non-existing module 'http_conf' in mod_auth:load/2. Corrected.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3459
<li>
An error (module mod_include) in the parsing of SHTML files could cause 
the handling process to crash. The reason was the reading of files was 
done in chunks. If a directive or comment starts at the end of a chunk
but ends in the next chunk, this was taken as EOF and an exception was
thrown. This exception was not handled which caused the process to crash.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3527
<li>
The FTP failure 'File system full' during file transfer is not handled properly.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3268, OTP-3503</ul>

<h3>
Improvements and new features</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The authentication modules have been rewritten with support for dets, plain
and mnesia authentication databases. There is also a new module called
'mod_secrity', which implements security event logging and notification.
Both the mod_auth and mod_security modules have an API for the programmer
that implements functions they will require to have full control over access
restricted parts of a site. NOTE: The mod_auth_mnesia module does not implement
the API previously found there, please see the mod_auth documentation.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-2281
<br>Aux Id: seq 740,OTP-2273

CGI scripts are now supported on Windows aswell as UNIX platforms.</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-2915

<br>Own Id: OTP-2982
<li>
The HTTP server now experimentaly supports persistent connections (as defined
in RFC2068). This is the first step towards HTTP/1.1 support. Enabling
this feature may greatly improve performance, as the server then uses the
same TCP connection for more than one HTTP request. Two new configuration
directives are defined for httpd_core: KeepAlive max-requests KeepAliveTimeout
seconds</li>

<br>Own Id: OTP-3032</ul>
